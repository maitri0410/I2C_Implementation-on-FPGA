Copyright (C) 2022 by Maitri Patel, Institute of Technology, Nirma University.

This Project is about I2C protocol implementation on FPGA.The code here is based on Verilog HDL.Here ALtera DE2(cyclone II) FPGA boards are used for implementation.
This project consist three module 1) I2c master 2)I2c slave and 3)I2C controller for verification of the protocol(simple testbench).
